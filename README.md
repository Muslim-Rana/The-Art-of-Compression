## Overview

This project is a project focused on C++ programming and data structures and algorithms. I will use the concept of the space-partioned tree data structure (also known as Triple Tree) to implement image compression in order to optimize our memory usage when storing images. A serialization and deserialization schema will also be implemented in order to convert a .png file to a TripleTree and vice versa. The motivation behind this project is to gain a richer understanding of advanced data strucutres and algorithms and to delve deeper into C++ and its wonders!
